# pythonprojects
These are my class projects created in Programming for Language Technologists at Uppsala University.

Loops.py is a basic loop that sums all the numbers in range 10. 
Mcdonald.py defines a function that takes two variables, an animal and a sound, then prints out the lyrics to Old McDonald with the inputted animal and sound.
Spiral.py contains a function that imports the turtle graphics module and then creates a spiral. User can change the angle of the spiral.
