# pythonprojects
These are my class projects created in Programming for Language Technologists at Uppsala University.

A majority of the projects deal with learning how to program with python and as such have elementary functions, loops, dictionary creations/editing, list creation/editing, and conditional statements.

Inducks_final.py is a group project that allows user to search through a comic book corpus of Disney comicbooks for specific characters and returns the titles in which a specified character appears.

In ballsrace.py, I was tasked to modify existing code to allow for the user to state the number of players playing the game as well as the size and shape of the balls. The code I created are the "nob" variable and the "ball_rows" variable.
